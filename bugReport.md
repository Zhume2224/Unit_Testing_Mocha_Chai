Title:
Phone Number field accepts alphabetic characters

Description:
The "Phone Number" input field allows users to enter alphabetic characters (e.g., "abc123"), which should not be permitted. The field is expected to accept only numeric input (0â€“9).

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Navigate to the form page.
2. Locate the "Phone Number" input field.
3. Enter a combination of letters and numbers (e.g., "abc123").
4. Submit or attempt to proceed.

Expected Result:
The field should accept only numeric input. Alphabetic characters should be blocked or trigger a validation error.

Actual Result:
The field accepts alphabetic characters without any validation error or restriction.

Impact:

* Data inconsistency in user records
* Possible failures during backend validation or processing
* Poor user experience

Severity:
Medium

Environment:

* Browser: Chrome 115.0.5790.171
* OS: Windows 10
* Build: v1.3.5 (Staging)
